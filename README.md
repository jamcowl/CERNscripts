# CERNscripts
Various scripts to make CERN life easier, with various amounts of explanation :P

CERN Words:

xAOD: ATLAS Run 2 datasets, contain oodles of physics data, Size: ~100's of GB to TBs each

DxAOD : "Derived xAOD", made by dedicated teams for different classes of analyses, Size: 10's of GB to 100's each

MxAOD: "Mini xAOD," made by me :P , made for the largest analysis subgroup (Higgs-> gamma gamma), Size: ~100 MB to a few GB each.

EOS: CERN Mass storage solutions with large group-specific areas, where I stored the MxAODs

Grid: The CERN computing grid.  Used by me to produce the large amount of MxAODs from the large DxAODs.

MC: Monte-Carlo, Simulated physics data used for analysis and comparison to data

Data: Actual physics data from the ATLAS detector
